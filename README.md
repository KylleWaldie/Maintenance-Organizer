This project is the start of a Parts organizer for my work maintenance department. It allows the user to add parts to the database and see how many parts are in the database. The user can also remove or add parts freely to the database as they are used and bought. The project will later have a window where they can view all the parts and the amount they have and will later be able to sort by part number or part type. This project uses C# as the main language with SQL-Lite as the database while using the .Net framework. The database is a local database so it can only be used on one computer to access the database but I have plans to change it to a cloud-based database.
